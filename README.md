**Welcome to my Personal Website!**
---
This is a basic website I made for my Independent Study CS class my senior year of highschool.
  ### What it's made with:
  - [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

*Note that some of the CSS is embedded within the index.html file, and the tailwind.config.js file houses most of the color and text customizations.
That's the nice thing about Tailwind vs regular CSS, as it has utility classes and inline styles that fit right in with the HTML markup.
